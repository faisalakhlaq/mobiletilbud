# Mobiletilbud

While I was looking for a mobile phone on sale (offer) with a subscription, the search gave the idea and `Mobiletilbud` was developed.
Pricerunner and some other websites have a database of mobile phones on sale, but if you are looking to buy a phone from a telecom company e.g. 
(Telenor) with subscription, there is no single platform that gathers offers from such companies (so one has to visit and check websites for each individual company).
Through `Mobiletilbud` all the mobile phones (alongwith their specifications) are available in one place. 
Check the differet mobile phone specs and select which one you like, then check the sale offers on the selected phone. 

## A website build using Django. 

MobileTilbud website provides information about mobiles and offers from all telecom companies in Denmark.
The sales offers are regularly fetched from the telecom companies by scraping their websites.

There is a large database of mobile phones (over 4000) containing specifications of mobiles along with their pictures.

Users can search for different mobiles and sales offers. Business users can create accounts on the website and create their own offers,
which will be displayed along the other offers.
